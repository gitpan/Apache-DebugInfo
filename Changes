Revision history for Perl extension Apache::DebugInfo.

0.01  4.3.2000
	- original version
        - many kudos and gratitude to those who offered
          their suggestions and improvements prior to
          the first release:
            Ask Bjoern Hansen
            Graham Barr
            René Seindal
        
0.02  4.4.2000
        - fixed bug in ip match that required an ip address
          to check against
        - added Data::Dumper support to pnotes - not as pretty
          as the stuff before, but it now supports complex
          data structures and is less bulky  
          Suggested by René Seindal
	- minor pod and documentation changes
